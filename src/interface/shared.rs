/// Retrieve the IP address of the default network interface.

/// This function attempts to bind a UDP socket to an unspecified IP address (0.0.0.0)
/// and port (0), which allows the system to select an appropriate IP address and port.
/// After binding, it attempts to connect the socket to a designated non-routable IP address
/// (`10.254.254.254` on port 1). This is a trick commonly used to prompt the OS to
/// populate the socket's local address with the IP address of the interface that would
/// route to the specified address.
///
/// The function returns the local IP address if these operations succeed.
/// If any operation fails (binding, connecting, or retrieving the address),
/// the function returns `None`, indicating the inability to determine the local IP.
///
/// Returns:
/// - `Some(IpAddr)`: IP address of the default network interface if successful.
/// - `None`: If any error occurs during the operations.
